Design Patten:-

The Strategy Pattern:   
is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime. Here's a real-world example of the Strategy Pattern:

Real-World Example:  
Payment Processing
Consider an e-commerce system that processes payments in different ways, such as credit card payments, PayPal, and Bitcoin. Each payment method has its own algorithm for processing payments. The Strategy Pattern can be applied to encapsulate these algorithms and allow the client (e-commerce system) to choose a payment method dynamically.

The Template Method Pattern:  
is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It is used to create a method's template, where the overall structure is defined in a base class, and specific steps can be implemented by concrete subclasses.

************************************************
Java 8 introduced several significant features and concepts that aimed to improve the language's expressiveness, simplicity, and support for modern programming practices. Some key concepts introduced in Java 8 include:

Lambda Expressions:

1. Lambda expressions enable the concise representation of anonymous functions (functional interfaces) in Java.
They are particularly useful for writing code in a more functional style.
   Functional Interfaces:

2. Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method and can have multiple default or static methods.
The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to ensure that an interface has only one abstract method.
