`The Strategy Pattern`   
is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime. Here's a real-world example of the Strategy Pattern:

Real-World Example:  
Payment Processing
Consider an e-commerce system that processes payments in different ways, such as credit card payments, PayPal, and Bitcoin. Each payment method has its own algorithm for processing payments. The Strategy Pattern can be applied to encapsulate these algorithms and allow the client (e-commerce system) to choose a payment method dynamically.

`The Template Method Pattern`  
is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It is used to create a method's template, where the overall structure is defined in a base class, and specific steps can be implemented by concrete subclasses.


`The Observer Pattern`   
is a behavioral design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, known as observers, that are notified of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods. This pattern is widely used in scenarios where a change in one object requires changing others, such as keeping multiple views in sync with a model.

Let's consider a real-world example to illustrate the Observer Pattern:

Real-World Example:  
Weather Station
Imagine a weather station that gathers weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure) and broadcasts this information to multiple displays, such as a current conditions display, a statistics display, and a forecast display. The weather data is the subject, and the displays are the observers.

`The Decorator Pattern`   
is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is achieved by creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. This pattern is useful for adding functionalities to classes in a flexible and reusable way.

`The Factory Pattern`   
is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It involves defining an interface or abstract class for creating objects and letting the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns.

Here's a real-world example to illustrate the Factory Pattern:

Real-World Example: Vehicle Manufacturing
Consider a scenario where a vehicle manufacturing plant produces different types of vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles. The manufacturing process involves several steps, and different models of cars and motorcycles have variations in these steps.

`The Abstract Factory Pattern`    
is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It involves creating multiple factory interfaces (abstract factories), each responsible for creating a family of related products. Concrete factories implement these interfaces to produce specific product instances.

`Java New Features`

Java 8 introduced several significant features and concepts that aimed to improve the language's expressiveness, simplicity, and support for modern programming practices. Some key concepts introduced in Java 8 include:

Lambda Expressions:

1. Lambda expressions enable the concise representation of anonymous functions (functional interfaces) in Java.
They are particularly useful for writing code in a more functional style.
   Functional Interfaces:

2. Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method and can have multiple default or static methods.
The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to ensure that an interface has only one abstract method.
