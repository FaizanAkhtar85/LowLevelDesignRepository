Java 8 introduced several significant features and concepts that aimed to improve the language's expressiveness, simplicity, and support for modern programming practices. Some key concepts introduced in Java 8 include:

Lambda Expressions:

1. Lambda expressions enable the concise representation of anonymous functions (functional interfaces) in Java.
They are particularly useful for writing code in a more functional style.
   Functional Interfaces:

2. Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method and can have multiple default or static methods.
The @FunctionalInterface annotation can be used to ensure that an interface has only one abstract method.
